# Dockerfile Build Failure: Missing requirements.txt or Package Errors

This repository demonstrates a common error encountered when building Dockerfiles. The original Dockerfile attempts to install Python packages using `pip3` from a `requirements.txt` file, but the file is missing or contains errors leading to a build failure.  The solution addresses this by including a valid `requirements.txt` file and specifying the Python version accurately.

## Bug
The original `Dockerfile` fails to build because `requirements.txt` is missing or contains errors. This is a frequent issue stemming from improper file handling or package dependencies.

## Solution
The solution incorporates a `requirements.txt` file containing necessary packages and ensures correct package installation through `pip3`.  It also enhances the Dockerfile by using a more specific base image for better efficiency and security.
